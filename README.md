# SMU_CapstoneProject_ComparisonWebsite

## Introduction

Financial :moneybag: comparison websites are not new. It started with MoneySmart many years ago as a personal budgeting website and eventually included credit cards and other financial products. Weâ€™re seeing seismic shifts in the ways which people grow and spend their money.

However, as a person of faith, I can only consume shariah-compliant products (or interest-free products). Hence, my project is about developing a shariah-compliant comparison website that can serve this demographic, especially in SEA.

## Tech Stack

Figma, Trello, Git, PHP (Laravel), HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), MYSQL and Heroku (<http://smartmamat.herokuapp.com>)
 
 (http://www.google.fr/ "Named link title") 


## Key Features (App Ready)

1. Browse products (logged in or not)
2. Register and Login (upon admin's role setting and approval). This opens the door for a strict verification process which may involve IC verification.
3. Add reviews
4. Edit reviews
5. Custom middleware for admin to moderate content

  
## Limitations

1. For new reviews, users have to input the userid, bankname and productname. For edit reviews, users have to input the new reviewid. Ideally we want all these to be prefilled in the backend and only allow the user to submit the title, review and rating.

## Future improvements

1. Work on existing limitations.
2. Imrpove the graphics and display (an overhaul of the entire site design and perhaps try other CSS frameworks like Tailwind).
3. Include verification process.
4. Publish to AWS.


## Reflections

The concepts in PHP (Laravel) were fairly easy to understand. Moving forward, I'd like to further develop my knowledge and experience in PHP (Laravel) by working on it in the near future.
