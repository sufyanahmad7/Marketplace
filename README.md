# Marketplace

## :book: Introduction

Financial comparison websites are not new. It started with MoneySmart many years ago, followed by Singsaver and Seedly. Today, weâ€™re seeing seismic shifts in the ways which people buy financial products, grow and spend their money.

However, as a person of faith, I can only use shariah-compliant products (or interest-free products). Hence, my project is about developing a shariah-compliant comparison website that can serve this demographic, especially in SEA.

## :computer: Tech Stack

Figma, Trello, Git, PHP (Laravel), HTML/CSS (Bootstrap), MYSQL and Heroku

## :white_check_mark: Key Features (App Ready)

1. Browse products (regardless logged in or not)
2. Register and login (upon admin's role setting and approval). This opens the door for a strict verification process which may involve IC verification.
3. Add reviews
4. Edit reviews
5. Custom middleware for admin to moderate content

  
## :x: Limitations

1. For new reviews, users have to input the userid, bankname and productname. For edit reviews, users have to input the new reviewid. Ideally we want to fetch the data from backend to prefill the for. This leaves the user to only key in the remaining fields such as the title, review and rating.

## :runner: Future improvements

1. Work on existing limitations.
2. Improve the graphics and display (an overhaul of the entire site design and perhaps try other CSS frameworks like Tailwind).
3. Include verification process.


## :bowtie: Reflections

The concepts in PHP (Laravel) were fairly easy to understand. But moving forward, I'd like to continue building on my Python skill set. 

Difficulty Level: :six:
